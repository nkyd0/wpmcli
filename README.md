# wpmcli (it doesn't even work so don't download, you can look at source code though if you want)
a really shitty typing test...

you know how to install, just git clone it.
(you can also use in windows and mac (and debian) if you just execute the .py)

you can add more words to ```wordlist.txt``` if you like

the accuracy is by word so it isn't that good.

in the .py file, there's a function called ```get_random_words```, you can change ```num_words=10``` to whatever number.
that's pretty much it
